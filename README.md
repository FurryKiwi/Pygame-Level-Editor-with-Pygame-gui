# Pygame-Level-Editor-with-Pygame-gui
A simple level editor/creator made with pygame and pygame-gui. Has built in brush sizes and auto-tiling.

I built this more to see how auto-tiling worked and how it's implemented. 
I decided to put it up here for educational purposes for anyone wanting to learn how others have built basic level editors when their creating their games and for those that don't want to use a game engine and instead build all their own tools.
